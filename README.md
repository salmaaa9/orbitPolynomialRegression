# orbitPolynomialRegression
This task aims to study the relationship between orbital positions and time by performing polynomial regression using a neural network implemented in Keras. We will utilize an orbital dataset containing time and corresponding position data to analyze and visualize the patterns.

the data set is composed of two layers 
the time slot and the position of the orbit at this time
